                    <p>Every day, more than 13,000 nurses and other health workers help the Lifeline Blood Bank fulfill 
                        its purpose. These volunteers and staff members are talented, practical, and giving, providing help 
                        to disaster victims, working in military hospitals, and collecting lifesaving blood. They create 
                        and teach a variety of courses, from CPR/first aid to disaster preparedness. They also work in 
                        management, supervision, and governance roles across our company.
